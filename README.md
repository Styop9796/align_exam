# Employee identification and document character recogonition

We need to create 2 separate services.

## Description

In employee_identification service we have one model , and 3 API's for creating and showing employee data based on requirements.
(I got some issues with uploading image when creating employee record)

In service 2 created template to upload image and process OCR. Unfortunetly time was not enough to implement all functionality 
for saving record in database column

## Getting Started

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Help
I created run.py file to run two application within one file ( but there is some issue, hope will learn everyting in intership =) )

Now , I can run them separately .
